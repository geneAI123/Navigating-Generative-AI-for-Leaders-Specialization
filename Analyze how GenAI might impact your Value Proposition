Certainly! Generative AI (GenAI) has the potential to significantly impact value propositions across various industries. Let's explore this further:

1. **Productivity Gain Potential**:
   - GenAI can lead to cost and/or effectiveness improvements. By automating tasks, it enhances productivity and streamlines operations¬π.
   - For example, in procurement, GenAI can eliminate friction caused by different time zones and busy schedules, aiding conversations with better-tailored talking points¬≥.

2. **Value Proposition Change**:
   - GenAI can drive new product and business models. Companies' value propositions may evolve due to GenAI-generated content or services.
   - Consider how GenAI could create original content across various modalities, such as text, code, images, video, and speech¬π.
   - Organizations need to assess the impact on their existing value propositions and be prepared for potential changes.

3. **Risk and Opportunity**:
   - While GenAI presents risks (such as costs exceeding value), it also offers investment opportunities. Assessments should be made on a sub-sector basis‚Å¥.
   - Direct and indirect financial benefits can offset costs, assuming effective process redesign, upskilling, and risk management‚Åµ.

4. **Critical Factors for Success**:
   - People and process change are crucial. Organizational transformation through GenAI is 70% about people, 20% about processes, and only 10% about technology¬π.
   - Funds should start assessing GenAI's impact across their portfolios, fund operations, and investment strategies.

In summary, GenAI can revolutionize productivity and reshape value propositions, but careful evaluation and strategic planning are essential for successful adoption¬≤. üåü
